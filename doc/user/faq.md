## Troubleshooting

### The tutor doesn't understand me
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- Reduce background noise
- Make sure your microphone is working

Polyglott already uses a slower speaking speed for children. If it's still too fast:

- Practice with text mode first

### The tutor gives strange responses
Try:
- Resetting the conversation (type `quit` and start again)
- Using simpler sentences
- Staying on topic with the current lesson

- Check your speaker volume
- Make sure speakers are connected
- Check Sound preferences in System Settings
